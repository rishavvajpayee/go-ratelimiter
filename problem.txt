Problem :
Implement a per-user API rate limiter.
Operations
* allowRequest(userID) -> bool
* getRemainingQuota(userID)
Rules
* Max N requests per T seconds
* Sliding window (not fixed window)
Concurrency Traps
* Time-based eviction while requests are arriving
* Per-user isolation vs global lock
* Memory growth control
What this tests
* Concurrent data structures
* Lock sharding
* Time-sensitive correctness;
